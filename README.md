Movie Recommendation System Using AE (AutoEncoders).


Recommendation Systems are a type of information filtering systems as they improve the quality of search results and provides items that are more relevant to the search item or are realted to the search history of the user.  We propose a deep learning approach based on autoencoders to produce a collaborative filtering system which predicts movie ratings for a user based on a large database of ratings from other users. Using the MovieLens dataset, we explore the use of deep learning to predict users' ratings on new movies, thereby enabling movie recommendations.
